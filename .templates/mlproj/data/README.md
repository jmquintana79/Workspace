# data folder
- **data/raw**: here all raw data exists. This directory should be considered as read only - just leave what we got as it is.
- **data/processed**: data after whole preprocessing, merging, cleaning, feature engineering etc.
- **data/intermediate**: intermediate format between raw and processed. Not raw and also not ready yet.
- **data/external**: any data we consider as being external. E.g dictionaries, synonyms.
